A clean, single-page personal portfolio built with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It features a dark-mode aesthetic and includes an interactive 'Computer Information Scan' module to demonstrate dynamic web development skills.

## Features

-   **Interactive 'Computer Scan' Module:** A simulated scan animation created with CSS keyframes and managed by JavaScript that fetches and displays real browser and system information using APIs
-   **About Me & Interests:** A concise introduction to my background and current interests in the tech and security landscape.
-   **Responsive Design**

## Technical Information

-   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
-   **APIs Used:** Fetch API, Battery Status API, WebGL API, User-Agent Client Hints API, Internationalization API

This project was also an opportunity to demonstrate browser fingerprinting techniques. It shows how easily a combination of seemingly harmless data (IP, GPU, battery status, resolution, etc.) can be aggregated.
